    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This edible cookie dough recipe is egg-free and will satisfy any cravings for chocolate chip cookies without the wait. I have made this with friends before and they said that they loved the taste. So do I. The leftovers will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Mini chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use: Place flour in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 1 minute and 15 seconds, stirring it every 15 seconds. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms. Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips.</li>
    </ol>
